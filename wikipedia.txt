In the heart of the city, a small bakery stood tall, famous for its croissants. Every morning, the aroma of freshly baked bread filled the streets! Every morning, Anna would open the doors with a smile, ready to serve.

Every morning, people gathered outside the bakery, waiting for their turn. Every night, she would prepare the dough, knowing the next day would be just as busy. As the sun rose, people came one by one, excited to taste the famous pastries. Anna, the owner, greeted them all with a cheerful "Good morning!"

One day, a mysterious man entered the shop. He wore a long coat, and his hat covered most of his face. "I'd like a dozen croissants, please," he said in a deep voice. Every time Anna served him, he paid in exact change and left without saying much more.

The man paid and left, disappearing into the crowd. Later that evening, Anna found a note tucked under the counter. It read: "Meet me at the old pier at midnight. Come alone." Confused and worried, Anna spent the next few hours pondering her decision. Should she go?

Midnight arrived, and Anna stood at the pier, her heart racing. Suddenly, the mysterious man appeared. "Thank you for coming," he said quietly. "There's something important you need to know."

Every time she thought about the encounter, she couldn't shake the feeling of unease. Every week, the man came back, never missing a day.
